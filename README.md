This is my progress of senior project, stock price prdiction
"Study from the prices of three stocks with significantly different prices"

In the current,using transformer models, especially for their self-attention mechanism,
to predict stock prices. The tools mentioned are essential, including hardware like computers 
or notebooks, and software like Google Colab, Excel, and Visual Studio Code. Using 
transformer models for stock prediction is an intriguing idea, but the stock market is highly 
unpredictable due to various global events. It's difficult to use this for actual trading, but you 
can certainly explore it as a learning experience and to gain insights into the stock market 
trends. Just keep in mind that accurate stock prediction requires a deep understanding of 
financial markets and additional data sources, not just the model itself
